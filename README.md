# TDD Workshop

Please clone the repo and complete the exercise working in pairs!


## Exercise

We need to implement a lambda function that:

* Will request a random number between 1 and 100. You can use an online service like http://numbersapi.com/random?min=1&max=100&json
* If the number is multiple of 3, the lambda function should return `Fizz`.
* If the number is multiple of 5, it should return `Buzz`.
* If the number is both multiple of 3 and 5, it should return `Fizzbuzz`.
* If none of the above, return simply the number.
* If there is any error, the deliver team should be emailed about it using SES (optional step, only if we have time).


## Considerations

* Work in pairs using the roles of driver and navigator. Swap every 2 minutes.
* Assume the API might fail. Cover failures.
* Use async/await in your implementation.
